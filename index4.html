    <pre class="stuff">                            We aim to dismantle the mystic that comes with design school. 
                         By sharing resources from all the Parsons majors 
                         we will be allowing people who can not afford the education
                         and or are not looking to pursue a degree an opportunity to learn.  
                         Allowing information to be shared through our platform 
                         from students of all backgrounds, 
                         we will make our content diverse and interactive.
